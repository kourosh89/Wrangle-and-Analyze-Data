# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. In this project, I will go through the process of data wrangling which is gathering, assessing, and cleaning and finally will derive interesting insights from the cleaned data and communicate my findings with visualizations
